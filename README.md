## About

vLLM is a fast and easy-to-use library for TTS inference and serving.

Originally developed in the [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley, vLLM has evolved into a community-driven project with contributions from both academia and industry.

vLLM is fast with:

- State-of-the-art serving throughput
- Efficient management of attention key and value memory with [**PagedAttention**](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html)
- Continuous batching of incoming requests
- Fast model execution with CUDA/HIP graph
- Quantizations: [GPTQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323), [AWQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978), [AutoRound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05516), INT4, INT8, and FP8
- Optimized CUDA kernels, including integration with FlashAttention and FlashInfer
- Speculative decoding
- Chunked prefill

vLLM is flexible and easy to use with:

- Seamless integration with popular Hugging Face models
- High-throughput serving with various decoding algorithms, including *parallel sampling*, *beam search*, and more
- Tensor, pipeline, data and expert parallelism support for distributed inference
- Streaming outputs
- OpenAI-compatible API server
- Support for NVIDIA GPUs, AMD CPUs and GPUs, Intel CPUs and GPUs, PowerPC CPUs, Arm CPUs, and TPU. Additionally, support for diverse hardware plugins such as Intel Gaudi, IBM Spyre and Huawei Ascend.
- Prefix caching support
- Multi-LoRA support

vLLM seamlessly supports most popular open-source models on HuggingFace, including:

- Transformer-like LLMs (e.g., Llama)
- Mixture-of-Expert LLMs (e.g., Mixtral, Deepseek-V2 and V3)
- Embedding Models (e.g., E5-Mistral)
- Multi-modal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA)
